# buildpyramid
Build like an Egyptian :)

We would like to build pyramids that support the following:

1) (All) height levels are welcome! 
2) Billing system for the work hours, cost of material and number of blocks
3) Labor management. Workers should collaborate with engineers and build enough blocks given a worker's capacity is 2 blocks. Each Engineer would be able to architect maximum of 3 levels, otherwise another engineer would be added to the project.
4) History flavor. Each user would be able to get a pyramid of a specific design that has cetain # of levels, material and expected lifetime.
