# buildpyramid
Build like an Egyptian :)

We would like to build pyramids that support the following:

1) (All) height levels are welcome! 
2) Labor management: Builder should collaborate with engineers and build enough blocks.
    - A builder's capacity is 2 blocks.
    - Each engineer would be able to architect maximum of 3 levels, otherwise another engineer would be added to the project.

3) Billing system for the work hours, cost of material and number of blocks

4) History flavor. Each user would be able to get a pyramid of a specific design that has cetain # of levels, material and expected lifetime.

5) Lifetime is inverse proportional to number of levels and direct proportional to quality of materials used.
